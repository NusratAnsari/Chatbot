# Chatbot
A chatbot is a computer program that can converse with humans using artificial intelligence in messaging platforms. The goal of the project is to add a chatbot feature and API for Yioop,discussion groups, blogs, wikis etc. Yioop provides all the basic features of a web search portal. It has its own account management system with the ability to set up groups that have discussions boards. Groups are collections of users that have access to a group feed. The user who creates a group is set as the initial group owner. Posts are grouped by thread in a group containing the most recent activity at the top. The chatbot API for Yioop will allow developers to create new chatbots, powered by rules or artificial intelligence, that can interact like a human with users in a groups feed page. Example chatbots that can be developed with this API is weather chatbots or book flight chatbots. Over the past few years, messaging applications have become more popular than Social networking sites. People are using messaging applications these days such as Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, Telegram, Slack etc. This is making other businesses available on messaging platforms leads to proactive interaction with users about their products. To interact on such messaging platforms with many users, the businesses can write a computerprogram that can converse like a human which is called a chatbot.
